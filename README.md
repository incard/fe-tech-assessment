Build a Star Wars resources explorer using [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/documentation). 

- A user should be able to navigate to a certain resource through the home page e.g. by clicking on the film link should navigate and display all of the items.
- Display items in a grid or any layout style that will enhance the user experience and is responsive.
- Users should be able to search items when they are on a resource page.
- Each item should have its own page to display further details. Please use fields that are relevant.
- The UI part is left to you. Please feel free to use your imagination there. We love slick and minimal designs.
- Focus on 2 resources only but not all.

## Prefer tools

- React with SSR
- Typescript
- Would be nicer to see some unit test coverage.
