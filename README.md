Build a Star Wars resources explorer using [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/documentation). 

- Users should be able to navigate to resource through the home page e.g. by clicking on the film link should navigate and display all of the items.
- Display items in a grid or any layout style that will enhance the user experience. Please ensure its responsive.
- Users should be able to search for item/items when they are on a specific resource page.
- Each item should have its own page to display further details. Please use fields that are relevant.
- The UI part is left to you. Please feel free to use your imagination there. We love slick and minimal designs.
- Focus on 2 resources only but not all.

## Prefer tools

- React with SSR
- Typescript
- Would be nicer to see some unit test coverage.

Please, feel free to reach out to us if you have any question. Share your github repo once you are done. Thank you and good luck!
